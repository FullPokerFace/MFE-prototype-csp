# ðŸš€ Converting CSP to Module Approach: Progress Tracker

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Core Functionality

- [x] Export & consume constants from module
- [x] Export & consume styled component from module
- [x] Export & consume Images from module
- [x] Export & consume Containers with stores

### State Management

- [x] Inject Reducer & Actions
- [x] Middleware

### Dependencies

- [x] Using side libraries in components ('react-bootstrap')
  - _Note: Need to install both dependency & main_

### Module Interaction

- [x] Use resources of one UMD module inside another UMD module
  - _We can do it. Just load module resources and use them inside repo_

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

### Versioning & Deployment

- [ ] Versioning (load it from Content & consume in main-ui)
- [ ] CI/CD for deploying modules (static js)

### Development & Performance

- [ ] Running repo on local not as part of main-ui
- [ ] Latency while loading the modules

### Bug Fixes
