## Converting CSP to module approach

âœ… Export & consume constants from module
âœ… Export & consume styled component App from module
âœ… Export & consume Images from module
âœ… Export & consume Containers with stores
âœ… Inject Reducer & Actions
âœ… Middleware
âœ… Using side libraries in components ('react-bootstrap') - need to install noth dependency & main
âœ… Use resources of one UMD module inside another UMD module (we can do it. Just load module resources and use them inside repo)

ðŸš§ Versioning (load it form Content & consume in main-ui)
ðŸš§ CI/CD for deploying modules (static js)
ðŸš§ Running repo on local not as part of main-ui
ðŸš§ Latency while loading the modules
ðŸš§ Wallet-ui repo renders errors showing connect not found
